Wireframe Layout Assessment 15%

This assessment will test your ability to build a clean, semantic HTML structure and create a fluid layout based on a provided design. You will demonstrate matching a given document outline with semantic elements, using div elements as containers, applying Flexbox layout techniques, and ensuring the design is fluid and uses relative units of measurement. You will submit your work via GitHub Classroom, following version control best practices.

Requirements &amp; Build Instructions:

Create a new project folder and markup the HTML using semantic elements to match the provided outline. The h1 heading can be placed outside of the header, but it should be grouped with all the content that belongs to it. Ensure that the HTML is valid, properly formatted, and groups related content together before moving on to the CSS styling. Use div elements only as containers or wrappers for CSS purposes.&nbsp;

The website is not fully responsive (it is not mobile-first), but it must have a fluid layout using relative units of measurement (rem or %) for widths, spacing, and typography. The flex shorthand property for flexible sizing, along with a max-width container that allows the content to resize while staying centered. Ensure your flex shorthand settings (flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis) allow elements to shrink proportionately as the viewport changes.

Test your layout at various viewport widths. When the viewport is reduced, the content should adjust proportionately to fit the available space. There should be no overflowing content when the viewport is reduced to tablet size (around 768px). Once the viewport shrinks past the natural content width, overflow is acceptable.

(See screenshots)

Styling should match the Figma design as closely as possible. Pay attention to the light grey background on the frame, as it may be difficult to see. Include the hover states found in the hidden layers of the Figma file

Do not use CSS Grid, positioning properties (position: absolute, etc.), or any frameworks.

Submission:

Push the completed assessment to the GitHub classroom before the due date. Late pushes will be counted as late submissions and will not be accepted unless prior arrangements are made.
